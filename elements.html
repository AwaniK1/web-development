<p>1.Staple Foods: The staple food of Tibetans is tsampa, a roasted barley flour that is often mixed with<br> butter tea (suja) to form a dough-like consistency. This serves as a basic diet for many Tibetans,<br> especially nomads.</p>
<br>
<p>2.Meat Dishes: Due to the cold climate and high altitude, meat plays a significant role in Tibetan<br> cuisine. Yak meat is particularly popular, used in various forms such as yak butter, dried yak meat <br>(drokpa), and even yak yogurt.</p>
<br>
<p>3.Dairy Products: Dairy products are essential in Tibetan cuisine, with butter tea (made from yak<br> butter and tea leaves) being a staple drink. Yogurt, cheese (chura loen), and various milk-based sweets are also common.</p>
