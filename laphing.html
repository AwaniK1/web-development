Prepare the sauce:<br>

Heat vegetable oil in a small pan over medium heat.<br>
Add minced garlic and ginger, saut√© until fragrant and lightly golden.<br>
Stir in soy sauce, chili paste, vinegar, and salt. Cook for another minute, then remove from heat and let it cool.<br>
Assemble the Laphing:<br>

Once the Laphing jelly has set, remove it from the refrigerator and cut it into thin strips or cubes.<br>
Arrange the Laphing on serving plates or bowls.<br>
Drizzle the prepared sauce generously over the Laphing.<br>
Garnish with optional toppings like sliced cucumber, chopped cilantro, roasted peanuts, and sesame seeds.<br>
Serve and enjoy:<br>

Laphing is best enjoyed cold, making it a refreshing dish on hot days. The combination of spicy chili oil sauce with the cool, jelly-like texture of the Laphing creates a delightful culinary experience.<br>
