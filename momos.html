<p><b>Tibetan momos are delightful dumplings that hold a special place in Tibetan cuisine.<br>
 These dumplings are not only delicious but also reflect the rich culinary heritage of Tibet.<br>
 Typically, momos consist of a flavorful filling enclosed in a thin dough wrapper, which is then<br>
 either steamed or fried to perfection.</b></p>

<p> Here’s a traditional recipe to make Tibetan momos:<br>
Ingredients:<br>
For the dough:<br>

2 cups all-purpose flour<br>
Water, as needed<br>
1/2 teaspoon salt<br>
For the filling:<br>

1/2 lb ground meat (beef, lamb, or chicken)<br>
1 small onion, finely chopped<br>
2-3 cloves garlic, minced<br>
1-inch piece of ginger, minced<br>
2 tablespoons cooking oil<br>
1 teaspoon ground cumin<br>
1 teaspoon ground coriander<br>
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder<br>
Salt and pepper, to taste<br>
Fresh cilantro leaves, chopped (optional)<br>
Instructions:<br>
1. Prepare the dough:<br>

In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt.
Gradually add water and knead until a smooth dough forms. The dough should be soft and pliable. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for at least 30 minutes.<br>
2. Make the filling:<br>

Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and sauté until translucent.<br>
Add minced garlic and ginger, and cook for another minute until fragrant.<br>
Add the ground meat and cook until browned, breaking up any clumps with a spoon.<br>
Stir in the cumin, coriander, turmeric powder, salt, and pepper. Cook for a few more minutes until the flavors meld together.<br>
Remove from heat and let the filling cool completely. Stir in chopped cilantro if desired.<br>
3. Assemble the momos:<br>

Divide the rested dough into small walnut-sized balls. Roll each ball into a thin circle (about 3-4 inches in diameter) on a lightly floured surface.
Place a spoonful of the cooled filling in the center of each circle.<br>
To fold the momos, bring the edges together in the center, pleating them as you go, to form a pouch. Pinch the top to seal the momo. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.<br>
4. Steam the momos:<br>

Prepare a steamer by lining it with parchment paper or lightly greased cabbage leaves.<br>
Arrange the momos in the steamer, leaving space between each so they don’t stick together.<br>
Steam the momos for about 15-20 minutes, or until the dough becomes translucent and the filling is cooked through.<br>
5. Serve:<br>

Serve hot momos immediately with a dipping sauce made from soy sauce mixed with a little vinegar or chili sauce.</p>
