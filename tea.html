Recipe for Butter Tea<br>
Ingredients:<br>
<br>
2 cups water<br>
2 tablespoons loose leaf black tea (you can also use green tea if preferred)<br>
2 tablespoons unsalted butter (traditionally yak butter is used, but you can use cow's butter)<br>
1/4 teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)<br><br>

In a saucepan, bring 2 cups of water to a boil.<br><br>
Steep the Tea:<br>

Add 2 tablespoons of loose leaf black tea (or green tea) to the boiling water.<br>
Let it simmer for about 5 minutes. The longer you simmer, the stronger the tea flavor will be.<br><br>
Prepare the Butter:<br>

While the tea is simmering, in a separate bowl, soften 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter to room temperature.<br><br>

After simmering, strain the tea into a large bowl or teapot to remove the leaves.<br>
Pour the brewed tea into a blender or use a traditional churn (like a Tibetan churn) if available.<br>
Add the softened butter and salt to the tea.<br><br>
Blend or Churn:<br>

Blend the mixture in a blender for about 1 minute until it becomes frothy and well-mixed. If using a churn, churn vigorously until frothy.<br><br>
