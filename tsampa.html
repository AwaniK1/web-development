<p>Recipe for Tsampa Porridge:<br>
Ingredients:<br>
1 cup roasted barley flour (tsampa)<br>
1 cup boiling water<br>
Pinch of salt (optional)<br>
Sweeteners such as sugar, honey, or molasses (optional)<br>
Butter or ghee (optional)<br>
Instructions:<br><br>
Prepare the Tsampa:<br>

Place the roasted barley flour (tsampa) in a bowl.<br>
If you prefer, you can sift the tsampa to ensure it's fine and without any lumps.<br><br>
Mix with Boiling Water:<br>

Slowly pour the boiling water over the tsampa, starting with about half a cup.<br>
Use a spoon or chopsticks to mix the tsampa and water thoroughly. It should start to form into a crumbly texture.<br><br>
Adjust Consistency:<br>

Continue adding more boiling water, a little at a time, and mixing until you reach your desired consistency. Some people prefer a thicker porridge, while others like it more liquidy.<br><br>
Add Flavorings (Optional):<br>

If desired, add a pinch of salt to enhance the flavor.<br>
Sweeten your tsampa porridge with sugar, honey, or molasses to taste.<br><br>
Serve:<br>

Tsampa porridge is traditionally eaten warm. You can serve it plain or topped with a knob of butter or ghee for added richness and flavor.</p>
